## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Brain Wave Visualization:** Interactive monitoring of alpha, beta, theta, delta, and gamma brain waves with dynamic updates.
- **AI-Powered Pattern Recognition:** Integration with DeepSeek-R1 AI model for advanced neural pattern analysis and mental state identification.
- **Confidence-scored Insights:** Analysis results with reliability metrics for detected patterns and correlations.
- **Comprehensive Wave Information:** Detailed information about different brain wave types and their significance.
- **Data Export Capabilities:** Export raw data and analysis results in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, PDF) for further research.

## üß† Brain Wave Analysis

MindSight visualizes and analyzes five primary types of brain waves:

| Wave Type | Frequency | Mental State |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Alpha | 8-13 Hz | Relaxed, calm mental state |
| Beta | 13-30 Hz | Alert, actively thinking |
| Theta | 4-8 Hz | Deep meditation, sleep |
| Delta | 0.5-4 Hz | Deep sleep, regeneration |
| Gamma | 30-100 Hz | High cognitive processing |

The AI component analyzes relationships between different wave types to identify patterns indicating specific mental states, such as:
- Alpha-Beta correlation suggesting relaxed but alert states
- Theta spikes indicating moments of deep focus
- Gamma bursts corresponding to complex information processing

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React with functional components and hooks
- **Data Visualization:** Recharts for interactive and responsive charts
- **AI Integration:** Hugging Face's DeepSeek-R1 model via Inference API
- **Styling:** CSS with responsive design for all device sizes
- **Data Processing:** Custom algorithms for real-time synthetic data generation

## üìä Dashboard Interface

MindSight features an intuitive dashboard with multiple views:

- **Real-time Display:** Live visualization of brain wave activity across all frequency bands
- **AI Insights:** Neural pattern analysis with confidence scoring and time range indicators
- **Wave Patterns:** Educational reference on different brain wave types and their significance
- **Export Data:** Options to download raw data and analysis results in various formats
